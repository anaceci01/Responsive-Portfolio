            <h1> Ana Davis</h1>
            <p> name is Ana, a few call me by my middle name, Cecilia. I was born in Sonora, Mexico. My hometown,
                San
                Carlos is
                about 6 hours away from Tucson, and it is great place to visit. I grew up in Mexico City, where I
                met
                amazing
                people and visited
                wonderful places. I currently live in the lovely Tucson, AZ. I have
                managed to fall in love with this town, their food, traditions and even
                their weather.
            </p>

            <p> "Familia" and God comes first to me. My husband and three
                kids make me very happy, let's say I am very blessed to have them.
                I am slightly obsessed with sharks and cactus. I enjoy the beach, food,
                art and good music.
